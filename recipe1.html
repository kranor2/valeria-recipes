<h1> Parmesan Foast Turkey</h1>
<img src="./turkey.jpg">
<h2>Ingredients</h2>             
<ul>
<li>1 stick (8 tablespoons) unsalted butter, at room temperature</li>
<li>2 teaspoons minced fresh rosemary</li>
<li>2 teaspoons minced fresh thyme</li>
<li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
<li>Finely grated zest of 1 lemon</li>
<li>1 1/2 cups grated Parmesan (about 6 ounces)</li>
<li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
<li>One 10- to 12-pound turkey, spatchcocked by your butcher</li>
<li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
</ul>      
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Position an oven rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 375 degrees F. Fit a wire rack inside of a rimmed baking sheet; set aside.</li>
<li>Combine the butter, rosemary, thyme, garlic, lemon zest, 1/2 cup of the Parmesan, 1 teaspoon salt and several grinds of pepper in a medium bowl until smooth.</li>
<li>Pat the turkey dry, then season all over (both the underside/flesh and skin) with 1 tablespoon salt and several grinds of pepper. Place skin-side up on the prepared baking sheet.</li>
<li>Work your fingers between the skin and meat on the breast and top of the turkey legs to loosen, then rub the Parmesan-butter evenly under the skin. Rub the olive oil all over the skin, then sprinkle with the remaining 1 cup Parmesan.</li>
<li>Roast until the Parmesan is golden brown and an instant-read thermometer inserted into a thigh reaches 165 degrees F, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Let rest for 30 minutes before carving.</li>
